This is my note pad app :D

I tweaked it a little bit to add some more features :o

It allows you to create a category to file the notes in.
Whenever you add a category, it gets added to the dropdown selector. When you add a note, it might not show up. That's because there's some animations thrown in there. Hover over the added category and it should show up. If you click the list item, it'll change to an update form. :D

Thanks for reading
